# Programming in Python: An Introduction

By Andy King

The content in [Intro to Programming in Python](https://github.com/programming-in-python) is focused on helping the reader to understand the basics of programming using the Python language. This material borrows from, and builds upon, some of the content from [Programming the IoT](https://github.com/programming-the-iot) and my IoT programming book, [Programming the Internet of Things (O’Reilly Media)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401/).

This site has been developed to support my Introduction to Python Programming course at Northeastern University and will remain under development for some time.

If you're interested in IoT-specific applications written in Python (and Java), my IoT programming book, [Programming the IoT](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401/), covers a range of exercises that will help you understand edge-based and edge-to-cloud IoT ecosystems.

## Objectives

The Programming in Python project (and its associated repositories) has the following goals.

(1) Introduce Python as a programming language to support a variety of data processing use cases.

(2) Provide a background in sound programming concepts and engineering principles.

(3) Provide a baseline Python-based application platform for future courses, such as those I teach in Northeastern University's College of Engineering (e.g., Connected Devices and Building Digital Twins).

## Naming Conventions

This course uses a hybrid naming convention for pedagogical consistency:

- Functions / Methods: camelCase (e.g., `calculateGPA`, `saveStudentData`)
- Variables: snake_case (e.g., `student_id`, `current_time`)
- Classes / Modules: PascalCase (e.g., `StudentManager`, `DataProcessor`)

This deviates from standard Python [PEP 0008](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) conventions (snake_case for functions/variables, lowercase for modules) but provides consistency across course materials.
